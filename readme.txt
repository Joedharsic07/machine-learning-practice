What is Machine Learning?

	Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets, allowing them to make predictions on new, similar data without explicit programming for each task.

Types Of Machine Learning:

1) Supervised Learning:
	It uses the labeled inputs to train the model and learn the outputs. 
2) un Supervised Learning:
	It uses the unlabeled data to learn about patterns in data.
3) Reinforcement Learning:
	Agent Learning in an inactive environment based on rewards and penalties. 

Supervised Learning:
	Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.

Unsupervised Learning:
	Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes data without human intervention.

Reinforcement Learning:
	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that teaches software to make decisions to achieve optimal results.


K-Nearest Neighbors:

-Most basic classification algorithm
-It belongs to supervised learning
-Find intense application in pattern recognition
- it is non-parametric
-It does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data

Distance metrics used in KNN:

Euclidean Distance:
-It is a way to measure how far apart two points are
-It is simply the length of the straight line connecting those two points
